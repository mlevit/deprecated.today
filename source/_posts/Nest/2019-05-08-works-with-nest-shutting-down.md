## Extract

Since Nest joined Google’s hardware team last year, we’ve been working to make the smart home less complicated, and well, more helpful. A home where products are easy to set up, simple to manage and work seamlessly together. Today, we’re committing to that goal by bringing together all Nest and Home products under the Nest brand. Introducing Google Nest.

We’re reimagining how technology and services can deliver simple and helpful experiences in your home to do more for you and your family. Over the coming months, you’ll begin seeing changes across our products, accounts, services, and policies as we bring everything together under Nest.

Moving forward, Nest and Google Home devices and services will share these things:

### One Google Account to manage Nest and Google Home devices

Over the next few months, users with Nest Accounts will be invited to migrate to Google Accounts, benefiting from industry-leading protections and a single account across the Nest and Google Home apps, and all of Google’s other products. It also means Nest and Google Home devices and services can work even better together.

### One third-party device ecosystem

We want to unify our efforts around third-party connected home devices under a single developer platform – a one-stop shop for both our developers and our customers to build a more helpful home. To accomplish this, we’ll be winding down Works with Nest on August 31, 2019, and delivering a single unified experience through the Works with Google Assistant program. See the [Works with Nest FAQs](https://nest.com/whats-happening#works-with-nest-program) section below.

### One set of core commitments that apply across Nest and Google connected home devices and services

As Nest redefines technology in the home, there’s an opportunity to explain clearly and simply how our connected home devices and services work, and how we will respect your privacy. Learn more about Google’s commitment to privacy in the home.
